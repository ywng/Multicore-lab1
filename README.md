# parallel-travelling-salesman-problem
#### Refer to tsm.pdf
You have a group of n cities (from 0 to n-1). The traveling salesman must start from city
number 0, visit each city once, and does not have to come back to the initial city. You
will be given the distance between each city (cities are fully connected to each other).
You must pick the path with shortest distance. Note that there may be several paths that
satisfy the above conditions, you just need to find one of them.


For example,
Best path: 0 1 3 4 5 2
Distance: 36
